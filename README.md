# ProtoScriptVM Lua - ProtoPad For iPad

## Background:

### ProtoScriptVM is the script VM for ProtoPad: A live, on-device rapid prototyping IDE for iPad and is first product to be released in the forthcoming Proto Platform.

This is the binary framework distribution for public use in other products.

ProtoPad is both a low-code and no-code environment for creating applets which are called _"scenes"_.

With ProtoPad, you can use a node-based & parametric interface (no-code) **and/or** scripting (low-code) to create applets directly on your iPad.

Many libraries are included out-of-the box and ready to use. 

You can create data and event driven applets for use in:
* Data Science 
* Machine Learning
* Image/Audio/Video Processing
* 3D & AR Gaming
* Multimedia & Music Production 
* And many more areas...
